    "Welcome to Day 9. Today we're going to touch on some of the more theoretical, yet highly practical, concepts of linear algebra. Understanding ideas like linear independence and matrix rank is crucial for diagnosing issues in machine learning models and for comprehending the 'true' dimensionality of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives for Today:\n",
    "- Understand the concepts of linear combination, span, and linear independence.\n",
    "- Learn what a basis of a vector space is.\n",
    "- Define the rank of a matrix and its connection to linear independence.\n",
    "- Learn how to check for linear independence and calculate rank using NumPy.\n",
    "- Connect these concepts to data redundancy and feature selection in machine learning."

    "**Linear Combination:** A linear combination of vectors `v1, v2, ..., vk` is any vector of the form `c1*v1 + c2*v2 + ... + ck*vk`, where `c1, c2, ...` are scalars.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Span:** The span of a set of vectors is the set of *all possible* linear combinations of those vectors. For example, the span of two non-collinear 2D vectors is the entire 2D plane (R²).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Independence:** This is a critical concept. A set of vectors is **linearly independent** if no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others. In other words, none of the vectors are redundant. If a set of vectors is *not* linearly independent, it is **linearly dependent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basis and Dimension:** A **basis** for a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the entire space. The **dimension** of a space is the number of vectors in its basis. For example, the standard basis for R² is `{[1, 0], [0, 1]}`."

    "Rank is a fundamental concept for understanding your data in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Intrinsic Dimensionality:** Imagine you have a dataset with 50 features, but the rank of the feature matrix is only 10. This tells you that the 'intrinsic' or 'true' dimensionality of your data is much lower. The data points, despite living in a 50-dimensional space, actually lie on a 10-dimensional subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Data Redundancy:** A rank-deficient feature matrix means you have redundant features. For example, if you have features for 'height in feet' and 'height in meters', one is a simple linear combination of the other. They are linearly dependent, and the second feature adds no new information to the model. This is called **collinearity** (or multicollinearity).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Model Stability:** In models like Linear Regression, a feature matrix that is not full rank (i.e., has collinear features) can make the model unstable and the results unreliable. Techniques like PCA (which we've seen) are used to address this by projecting the data onto a lower-dimensional, full-rank subspace."
