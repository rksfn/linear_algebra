    "- Understand what vectors are (geometrically and algebraically).\n",
    "- Learn how to represent vectors using NumPy arrays.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Geometric Interpretation\n",
    "Geometrically, a vector is an object that has both **magnitude** (length) and **direction**. We often visualize them as arrows in space, starting from an origin (though they can be placed anywhere for addition, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a vector `[3, 4]` in 2D space can be seen as an arrow starting at `(0,0)` and ending at `(3,4)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algebraic Interpretation\n",
    "Algebraically, a vector is an ordered list of numbers. These numbers are called the **components** or **elements** of the vector. The number of components determines the **dimension** of the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A 2D vector: `[x, y]`\n",
    "- A 3D vector: `[x, y, z]`\n",
    "- An n-dimensional vector: `[x1, x2, ..., xn]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalars\n",
    "A **scalar** is simply a single number, representing only magnitude (e.g., 5, -10.5, 3.14). Scalars are used to scale (stretch or shrink) vectors."
